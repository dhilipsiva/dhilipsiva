I usually spend most of my time building python (micro)services. But I also have built production services with JavaScript (Frontend + Node), C, Go, PHP, Ruby, Objective-C, C# & Java. I have worked on all levels of a typical web application stack. I design (architecture), implement, deploy, scale and maintain backend code, frontend code & infrastructure. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that I built in the past:

* GraphQL, RPC & RESTful microservices with Python
* JavaScript frontends with Ember & React
* DevOps pipelines
* E2E Test Automation Framework (Horizontal & Vertical) with RobotFramework
* Native iOS apps
* Android and iOS device farms
* RaspberryPi bitcoin mining farm with custom ASIC chips
* Scaled a couple of high-traffic web applications
* Deploy services on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud (Fabric, docker, AWS copilot, Kubernetes, etc.)
* Small tech teams (5-15 engineers)
* Can design and develop resource-efficient, reliable, maintainable, secure & scalable products
* A bunch of open-source tools that are useful for web development.
* Contributed to a bunch of 3rd party open-source projects
* Reverse Engineered and "hacked" a bunch of mobile applications for fun
* Hobby IoT & robotic projects (very basic stuff)

Lately, I have developed a keen interest in Rust programming language, WebAssembly & Distributed software.

I also care a lot about progressive politics. I try to volunteer for progressive candidates around the world in whatever nano capacity I can.
