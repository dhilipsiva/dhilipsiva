I usually spend most of my time building python (micro)services. But I have worked on all levels of a typical web application stack. I design (architecture), implement, deploy, scale and maintain both backend & frontend code:

* GraphQL, RPC & RESTful microservices with Django/Flask
* JavaScript frontends with Ember & React
* iOS apps with Objective-C
* Have built Android and iOS device farm
* Scaled a couple of high-traffic web applications
* Deploy services on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud
* Containerize the applications
* Built small tech teams over and over again (5-15 engineers)
* Can design and develop one of the most resource-efficient products for a given problem
* Have developed a bunch of open-source tools that are useful for web development.
* Have contributed to a bunch of open-source projects

Lately, I have developed a keen interest in Rust programming language, WebAssembly & Distributed software.

I also care a lot about progressive politics. I volunteer for progressive candidates around the world.
